# Welcome to My Portfolio Website

Hi, I'm Nonso Iwedinobi, a passionate Front-End Web Developer with a creative touch. I specialize in crafting delightful digital experiences using a blend of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and React. I'm recently completed the Front-End Web Development Bootcamp, where I learnt core skills and gaining hands-on experience in building modern, responsive web applications. As a developer, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible on the web. I love turning ideas into pixel-perfect, interactive interfaces that captivate and engage users. Whether it's bringing a concept to life from scratch or collaborating on a team project, I thrive on the challenges and opportunities that web development offers.
